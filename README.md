# Heart-Diseases-Analysis.

#### My First Project in Power BI, This Project is about Heart Disease Poeple. It show the analysis of some factors like:

1- Cholesterol

2- Depression

3- Heart Rate

4- Gender

5- Chest Pain

6- Rest ECG

7- Colored Vessels

8- Exercise Included Angina


And Through Some Statistical Techniques like:
- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Conditional Probabilities and Bayes' Theorem
- Hypothesis Testing
- Machine Learning


##### I could Figure out some Hypotheses and prove it also.
1- Women are more like to suffer heart problems.

2- `Nonanginal Chest Pain` increases the possibility of being heart disease case.

3- `Fast Blood Sugar Increases` increases the possibility of being heart disease case.

4- `ST T Wave Abnormality` increases the possibility of being heart disease case.

5- People with no `Colored Vessels` increases the possibility of being heart disease case.

6- `Exercises Included Angina` helps avoide Heart Disease.

7-  `Thalassemia (Fixed Defect)` increases the possibility of being heart disease case.

8- `High Cholesterol` increases the possibility of being heart disease case

### Lastely I built a Machine Learning Model (Multi-Layer Perceptron) With 94% Accuracy.
